    <h3>Auto-Calibration of Surgical Laparoscope, Python Scripts</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Used an OpenCV library to compute a 
            transformation matrix of two images from the 
            same scene but different scaled value
        </li>
        <li>
            Created a GUI using TKinter that 
            scan a random frame from a surgical 
            laparoscope to then pass it to created algorithm mentioned above
        </li>
        <li>
            Returned a focus value from studying the 
            edges/corners of each frame to notify whether 
            the laparoscope should be re-focus or not
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Chest X-Ray Image Preprocessing for Disease Classification, Research Paper (first author)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
           Used Sobel and Scharr operators-based edge detectors to produce an image detecting the boundaries among the image elements
        </li>
        <li>
            Created a GUI using TKinter that 
            scan a random frame from a surgical 
            laparoscope to then pass it to created algorithm mentioned above
        </li>
        <li>
            Returned a focus value from studying the 
            edges/corners of each frame to notify whether 
            the laparoscope should be re-focus or not
